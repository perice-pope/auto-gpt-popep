Auto-GPT Docker Solution
This repository provides a Docker solution for running Auto-GPT and redirecting volumes, logs, and data files to AWS S3. It also includes instructions for configuring Redis data persistence in AWS ElastiCache as a stretch goal. The steps below outline how to set up and run the solution.

Prerequisites
- Docker: Install Docker on your system.
- AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) with appropriate permissions to access and manage S3 and ElastiCache resources.

Step 1: Set up AWS CLI
1. Install the AWS CLI on your system following the official documentation.
2. Configure the AWS CLI with the necessary credentials and permissions to access your AWS resources. Use `aws configure` to set up the credentials.

Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Amazon S3 service.
3. Create a new S3 bucket in your desired AWS region. Take note of the bucket name and the desired S3 paths for volumes, logs, and data files.

Step 3: Modify Docker Compose File
1. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in the repository.
2. Replace `your-bucket-name` in the volumes, logs, and data sections with the name of your S3 bucket.
3. Adjust the S3 paths (`volumes`, `data`, `logs`) according to your desired structure within the bucket.

Example:
```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  auto-gpt:
    image: popep/auto-gpt:1.0
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      MEMORY_BACKEND: ${MEMORY_BACKEND:-redis}
      REDIS_HOST: redis
    volumes:
      - s3://your-bucket-name/volumes:/app/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace
      - s3://your-bucket-name/data:/app/data
      - s3://your-bucket-name/logs:/app/logs
    depends_on:
      - redis

  redis:
    image: "redislabs/redisearch:latest"
    command: ["redis-server", "--loadmodule", "/usr/lib/redis/modules/redisearch.so"]
```

Step 4: Configure Redis Data Persistence in AWS ElastiCache (Stretch Goal)
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the Amazon ElastiCache service.
3. Create a new ElastiCache cluster with Redis as the engine.
4. Configure the cluster settings, such as node type, number of nodes, and replication.
5. Enable Redis data persistence in the ElastiCache cluster configuration to ensure that data is persisted to disk.
6. Take note of the endpoint URL and port of the ElastiCache cluster.

Step 5: Update Docker Compose File with ElastiCache Configuration
1. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to replace the `redis` service block with the following configuration:

```yaml
redis:
  image: "redislabs/redisearch:latest"
  command: ["redis-server", "--loadmodule", "/usr/lib/redis/modules/redisearch.so"]
  environment:
    - REDIS_HOST=your-elasticache-endpoint-url
    - REDIS_PORT=your-elasticache-port
```

Replace `your-elasticache-endpoint-url` and `your-elasticache-port` with the appropriate values from your ElastiCache cluster configuration.

Step 6: Start the Docker Container
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository directory.
2. Run the following command

 to start the Auto-GPT container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the Auto-GPT container with the updated Docker Compose file. The volumes, logs, and data files will be redirected to the specified S3 bucket, and Redis data will be persisted in AWS ElastiCache (if configured).

Additional Notes
- Ensure that the AWS CLI credentials used for running Docker have the necessary permissions to read from and write to the specified S3 bucket and ElastiCache resources.
- Refer to the AWS documentation for more details on configuring AWS CLI, setting up S3 buckets, and managing ElastiCache clusters.
