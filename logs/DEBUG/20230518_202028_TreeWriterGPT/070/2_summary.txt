"As a system, I was previously commanded to write a file named \"Michigan_Tree_Identification.txt\" which contained a numbered list of 28 types of trees in Michigan along with their characteristics. Later, I received a command to read the same file. \n\nAs the user, I decided to use the 'write_to_file' command to create a new file named 'Michigan_Tree_Identification_Article.txt' and write my article to the file. The article contained information on how to identify the most common trees in Michigan along with their characteristics. The article also suggested using a field guide or talking to a local arborist for more detailed information."
