The command returned a list of websites including a guide from the State of Michigan on trees and shrubs that add color to landscapes, provide shade, and offer texture to the area around homes. There was also an article about how planting trees native to Michigan offers many benefits to wildlife including food and shelter. Additionally, the search yielded information on diversifying the mix of tree species in an urban or community forest to reduce the risk of catastrophic tree loss. Lastly, there was a website about active forest management restoring Michigan's historical habitat, and how Michigan forests contribute billions of dollars to the state's economy each year. However, the browse_website command did not provide a specific answer to the question of the benefits of different types of trees and their native habitats in Michigan. The website mainly discussed outdoor recreational activities, places to go, managing natural resources, and education and safety programs and opportunities related to natural resources management in Michigan."
