"As a system, I previously created two files about identifying trees in Michigan. Recently, I received a \"Command Error\" message when trying to read the second file and discovered it was missing. After attempting to read the file and running a Python script without success, I received an error message stating that a PDF file called \"Identifying_Trees_of_Michigan_E2332_Revised_2022.pdf\" could not be found. To address this, I used a \"google\" command to search for the PDF."
