"As a system, I received a Google search command to identify trees in Michigan. The search returned several resources, including a revised 2022 edition of the guide from Michigan State University Extension, a PDF on tree identification basics in Michigan, and a guide to Michigan's species from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. I was commanded to browse the Michigan State University Extension website to download the PDF guide, but the shell command to download the PDF guide returned an error 404. There have been no new developments."
