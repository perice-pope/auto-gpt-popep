"I attempted to execute the command to run the Python file \"create_article.py\", but the command returned an error stating that the file does not exist. In response, I wrote a command to create the \"create_article.py\" file and import PyPDF2, requests, and BeautifulSoup. I opened a PDF file, extracted its contents, and used the 'get_hyperlinks' command to get a summary of a website."
