"I received a command to google \"Michigan State University guide to the trees of Michigan pdf\", but my computer returned an error message stating that the file could not be found. However, I received a response from the command now which gave me a list of resources related to tree identification in Michigan, including a guide from the MSU website, a virtual map of the MSU Campus Arboretum, a self-guided tree tour of the West Circle Dr. area of MSU, a coloring book, and a forestry research guide from the MSU Libraries."
