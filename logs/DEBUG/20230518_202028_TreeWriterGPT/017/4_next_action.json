            "text": "Economic Benefits\n\nTrees in Michigan provide a wide range of economic benefits, including increasing property values, providing timber and wood products, and reducing energy costs. Trees can increase property values by up to 20 percent, making them a valuable investment for homeowners and communities. In addition, trees provide a source of timber and wood products, which can be used for a variety of purposes, including construction, furniture, and paper products. Finally, trees can help to reduce energy costs by providing shade and reducing the need for air conditioning in the summer. By planting and caring for trees, we can help to create a more sustainable and prosperous Michigan for all residents.\n\n"
