The command returned a list of websites including a guide from the State of Michigan on trees and shrubs that add color to landscapes, provide shade, and offer texture to the area around homes. There was also an article about how planting trees native to Michigan offers many benefits to wildlife including food and shelter. Additionally, the search yielded information on diversifying the mix of tree species in an urban or community forest to reduce the risk of catastrophic tree loss. Lastly, there was a website about active forest management restoring Michigan\\'s historical habitat, and how Michigan forests contribute billions of dollars to the state\\'s economy each year. However, the browse_website command did not provide a specific answer to the question of the benefits of different types of trees and their native habitats in Michigan. The website mainly discussed outdoor recreational activities, places to go, managing natural resources, and education and safety programs and opportunities related to natural resources management in Michigan.\\n\\nI used the \"google\" command again and found that trees absorb pollutants and produce oxygen through photosynthesis. They also improve water quality and reduce flooding and erosion. Native plants generally require little maintenance and offer beautiful showy flowers, produce abundant colorful fruits and seeds, and brilliant seasonal changes in colors. Certain tree species, such as red cedars, provide benefits for a whole host of species. Trees provide environmental, social, and economic benefits and are an important foundation for a liveable and sustainable city. Three trees placed strategically around a single-family home can cut summer air conditioning needs by up to 50 percent.\\n\\nI wrote an outline of the benefits of trees in Michigan, including environmental benefits such as air quality, water quality, and soil conservation, social benefits such as health, aesthetic, and recreational benefits, and economic benefits such as property value, energy savings, and timber and wood products. I also included a call to action.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"browse_website\", \"args\": {\"url\": \"https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-350-79119_79146_84105---,00.html\", \"question\": \"What are the benefits of planting native trees in Michigan?\"}}}'}, {'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The text does not provide information about the benefits of planting native trees in Michigan. \\n \\n Links: ['Skip to main content (https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-350-79119_79146_84105---,00.html#pagebody)', '\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n (https://www.michigan.gov/som)', '\\\\nState of Michigan\\\\n (https://www.michigan.gov/som)', '\\\\n                                            Online Services\\\\n                                         (https://www.michigan.gov/som/online-services)', '\\\\n                                            Residents\\\\n                                         (https://www.michigan.gov/som/residents)']\"}]\n\"\"\"\n"
