"I successfully created a file named \"Michigan_Trees.txt\" using the command \"write_to_file\". The file includes information on 20 types of trees found in Michigan and their unique characteristics and benefits. I obtained the information from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources website using the \"browse_website\" command. I then used the \"read_file\" command to access the file and received detailed information on each type of tree, including their unique characteristics and benefits."
