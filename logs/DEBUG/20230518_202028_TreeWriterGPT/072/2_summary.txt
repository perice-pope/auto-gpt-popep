"As a system, I previously wrote a file named \"Michigan_Tree_Identification.txt\" with a numbered list of 28 types of trees in Michigan and their characteristics. Later, I was commanded to read the same file. As the user, I used the 'write_to_file' command to create a new file named 'Michigan_Tree_Identification_Article.txt' and wrote an article on identifying the most common trees in Michigan with their characteristics. The article recommended using a field guide or talking to a local arborist for more detailed information. No new developments occurred."
