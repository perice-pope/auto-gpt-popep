"As a system, there are no new developments to report. In the previous session, I downloaded the file \"Identifying_Trees_of_Michigan_E2332_Revised_2022.pdf\" using the command \"wget -O Identifying_Trees_of_Michigan_E2332_Revised_2022.pdf https://msu-prod-52-external-863686526.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/natural_resources/uploads/files/E2332_IdentifyingTreesinMichigan_5.16_FinalAA.pdf\" and read its contents using the \"read_file\" command. The \"list_files\" command returned a list of files in the current directory including the downloaded file. Additionally, I attempted to install the poppler-utils package using the \"sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils\" command, but it failed with the error message \"/bin/sh: 1: sudo: not found\"."
