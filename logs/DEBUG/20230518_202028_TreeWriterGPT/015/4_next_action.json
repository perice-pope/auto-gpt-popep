            "text": "Environmental Benefits\n\nTrees play a critical role in maintaining a healthy and sustainable ecosystem in Michigan. Among their many environmental benefits, trees help to improve air and water quality, reduce soil erosion, and provide habitat for wildlife. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the air, helping to reduce the impact of greenhouse gases on the environment. They also act as natural filters, trapping and removing pollutants from the water and soil. In addition, trees help to conserve soil by reducing erosion and promoting healthy soil structure and composition. By planting and caring for trees, we can help to create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable environment for ourselves and future generations.\n\n"
