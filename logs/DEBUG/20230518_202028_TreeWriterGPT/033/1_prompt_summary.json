Another result was a Michigan State University website with information on identifying over 75 different native species of trees in the state, as well as a publication that briefly describes 69 of the more common trees found in Michigan. There was also a House Grail article with pictures of the 28 types of trees in Michigan, as well as a Michigan State University news article that helps distinguish between pine, spruce, and fir trees. Additionally, there was a ClickOnDetroit article on how to identify the most common trees in Michigan, as well as a website called arborday.org with a pocket-sized tree identification manual. Finally, there was a Michigan.gov website with information on the best trees to plant to attract backyard wildlife and a website called thetreecenter.com with a guide to buying trees in Michigan.
