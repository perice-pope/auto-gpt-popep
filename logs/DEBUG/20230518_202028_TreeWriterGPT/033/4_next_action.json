        "reasoning": "Since I do not have user authorization to download files locally, I will use the 'browse_website' command to access the publication on the MSU website and read it from there. This will allow me to read the guide and create an outline for the article.",

        "criticism": "I need to make sure that the article is well-researched and accurate. I also need to make sure that the article is easy to read and understand, and that it provides valuable insights into the different types of trees found in Michigan.",
