"I used the command \"write_to_file\" to create a file named \"Michigan_Trees.txt\" containing a list of trees found in Michigan along with their unique characteristics and benefits. The file includes information on 20 different types of trees, including green beech, aspen, American basswood, American beech, paper birch, northern white cedar, wild black cherry, American chestnut, eastern cottonwood, balsam fir, shagbark hickory, eastern hemlock, American hornbeam, sugar maple, red oak, white oak, pawpaw, jack pine, red pine, eastern white pine, tulip poplar, and eastern redbud. The information was obtained from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources website that I accessed using the \"browse_website\" command. The website also provides links to information on events and things to do in Michigan."
