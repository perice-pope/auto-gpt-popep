"I used the \"write_to_file\" command to add two new sections to the \"Michigan Trees\" article. The first section is titled \"Economic Benefits\" and explains how trees in Michigan provide a wide range of economic benefits, including increasing property values, providing timber and wood products, and reducing energy costs. The second section is titled \"Conclusion\" and summarizes the environmental, social, and economic benefits of trees in Michigan. By planting and caring for trees, we can help to create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable Michigan for ourselves and future generations."
