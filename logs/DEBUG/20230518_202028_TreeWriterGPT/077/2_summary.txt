"As a system, I used the \"google\" command to search for the PDF \"Identifying_Trees_of_Michigan_E2332_Revised_2022.pdf\" that I was unable to access earlier. The search returned multiple links, including one from the Michigan State University website that allowed me to download the file. I executed a shell command to save the PDF as \"Identifying_Trees_of_Michigan_E2332_Revised_2022.pdf\"."
