"I used the command \"google\" with the query \"Michigan trees characteristics\" and received a list of helpful links from my computer. The website for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources provides information on Michigan's diverse range of fish, plants, trees, reptiles, amphibians, insects and mammals. The second link provides detailed information on identifying trees in Michigan, including more than 75 native species of trees. The third link explains that Michigan boasts around 100 tree species, with trees being the dominant life form and impacting everything that occurs in the forest."
