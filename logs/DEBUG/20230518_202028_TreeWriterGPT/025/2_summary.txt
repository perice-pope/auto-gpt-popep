"I used the \"write_to_file\" command to successfully create a final article on the benefits of trees in Michigan. I then used the \"list_files\" command to see the files in the current directory, which returned a list of files including the newly created article. I attempted to use the \"send_tweet\" command to share the article on Twitter, but encountered an error related to the consumer key. I then attempted to analyze the code for the \"send_tweet\" command to troubleshoot the issue."
