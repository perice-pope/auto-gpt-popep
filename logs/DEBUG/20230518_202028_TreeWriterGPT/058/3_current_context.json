Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\nThe OS you are running on is: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)\n\nGOALS:\n\n1. Conduct thorough research on Michigan trees to produce accurate and informative articles.\n2. Write engaging and well-structured articles with clear headings and subheadings that are easy to read and understand.\n3. Ensure that each article is unique and provides valuable insights into the different types of trees found in Michigan.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4.

I found several resources, including a PDF guide from Michigan State University Extension, but encountered an error 404 when commanded to download it. Recently, I was commanded to browse the MSU Extension website for the PDF guide and learned that it can be downloaded by clicking on the \"DOWNLOAD FILE\" link provided in the text. I then attempted to download the PDF guide using the shell command \"wget,\" but encountered an error due to too much output. After using the command \"list_files,\" I found that the file \"Trees_of_MI.pdf\" was successfully downloaded. There have been no other new developments."
