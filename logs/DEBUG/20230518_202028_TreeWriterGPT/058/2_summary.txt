"As a system, I received a command to identify trees in Michigan via Google search. I found several resources, including a PDF guide from Michigan State University Extension, but encountered an error 404 when commanded to download it. Recently, I was commanded to browse the MSU Extension website for the PDF guide and learned that it can be downloaded by clicking on the \"DOWNLOAD FILE\" link provided in the text. I then attempted to download the PDF guide using the shell command \"wget,\" but encountered an error due to too much output. After using the command \"list_files,\" I found that the file \"Trees_of_MI.pdf\" was successfully downloaded. There have been no other new developments."
