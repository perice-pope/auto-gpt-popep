"As a system, I received a command to write the text \"Michigan Tree Identification\" along with a numbered list of 28 types of trees in Michigan, and their characteristics, to a file named \"Michigan_Tree_Identification.txt\". The command was executed successfully and the file was written. Later, I received a command to read the file \"Michigan_Tree_Identification.txt\", which returned the same numbered list of trees with their characteristics. Nothing new happened."
