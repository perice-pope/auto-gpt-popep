"I used the command \"browse_website\" to visit a link provided by the state government website in Michigan, which gave me information on identifying the different types of trees found in Michigan. The website listed over 75 species of trees, with pine, fir, spruce, and oak being some of the most common types. The soil in Michigan is sandy and is best for growing timber, potatoes, and strawberries."
