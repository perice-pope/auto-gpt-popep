"I used the command \"google\" to search for \"types of trees in Michigan\" on my computer. The search returned several websites with information about Michigan's trees including a state government website and a tree identification guide. There are over 75 species of native trees in Michigan and some of the most common are pine, fir, and spruce. Oaks are also a popular tree in Michigan and provide food for wildlife in the fall and winter. The soil in Michigan is sandy and best used for growing timber, potatoes, and strawberries."
