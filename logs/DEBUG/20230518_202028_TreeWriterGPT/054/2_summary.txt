"As a system, I received a Google search command for \"identifying trees of Michigan pdf\". The search returned several resources including a revised 2022 edition of the guide from Michigan State University Extension, a PDF on tree identification basics in Michigan, and a guide to Michigan's species from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. The search also found a tree identification guide from the University of Michigan Press. I received a command to browse the Michigan State University Extension website to download the PDF guide. The website provided a link to download the guide by clicking on the \"DOWNLOAD FILE\" link. I then executed a shell command to download the PDF guide with the name Trees_of_MI.pdf. However, the command returned an error 404."
