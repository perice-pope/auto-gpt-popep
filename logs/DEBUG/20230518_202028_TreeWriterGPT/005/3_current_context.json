The soil in Michigan is sandy and is best for growing timber, potatoes, and strawberries. I used the command \"write_to_file\" to create a file named \"michigan_trees.txt\" that lists the different types of trees found in Michigan along with their characteristics. The publication briefly describes 69 of the more common trees found in Michigan, including apple/crabapple, ash, aspen, basswood, beech, birch, boxelder, buckeye, butternut, catalpa, cedar, cherry, chestnut, cottonwood, dogwood, elm, fir, hackberry, hawthorn, hemlock, hickory, hophornbeam, Juneberry/serviceberry, Kentucky coffeetree, locust, maple, mulberry, musclewood/blue beech, oak, osage orange, pawpaw, pine, poplar, redbud, sassafras, spruce, sumac, sycamore, tamarack, tulip tree/yellow poplar, walnut, and willow."
