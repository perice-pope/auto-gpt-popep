"I used the command \"browse_website\" to visit a link provided by the state government website in Michigan, which gave me information on identifying the different types of trees found in Michigan. The website listed over 75 species of trees, with pine, fir, spruce, and oak being some of the most common types. The soil in Michigan is sandy and is best for growing timber, potatoes, and strawberries. I used the command \"write_to_file\" to create a file named \"michigan_trees.txt\" that lists the different types of trees found in Michigan along with their characteristics. The publication briefly describes 69 of the more common trees found in Michigan, including apple/crabapple, ash, aspen, basswood, beech, birch, boxelder, buckeye, butternut, catalpa, cedar, cherry, chestnut, cottonwood, dogwood, elm, fir, hackberry, hawthorn, hemlock, hickory, hophornbeam, Juneberry/serviceberry, Kentucky coffeetree, locust, maple, mulberry, musclewood/blue beech, oak, osage orange, pawpaw, pine, poplar, redbud, sassafras, spruce, sumac, sycamore, tamarack, tulip tree/yellow poplar, walnut, and willow."
