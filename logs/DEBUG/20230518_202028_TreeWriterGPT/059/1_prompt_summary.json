I found several resources, including a PDF guide from Michigan State University Extension, but encountered an error 404 when commanded to download it. Recently, I was commanded to browse the MSU Extension website for the PDF guide and learned that it can be downloaded by clicking on the \"DOWNLOAD FILE\" link provided in the text. I then attempted to download the PDF guide using the shell command \"wget,\" but encountered an error due to too much output. After using the command \"list_files,\" I found that the file \"Trees_of_MI.pdf\" was successfully downloaded. There have been no other new developments.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"read_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"Trees_of_MI.pdf\"}}}'}, {'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Command read_file returned: Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'encoding'\"}]\n\"\"\"\n"
