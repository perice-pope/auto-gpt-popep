"I attempted to download the \"Identifying Trees of Michigan: E2332 Revised 2022\" pdf from the MSU website using the command \"download_file,\" but received an error that I do not have authorization. As an alternative, I used the \"browse_website\" command to access the publication and asked how to access it. Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The \"Identifying Trees of Michigan: E2332 Revised 2022\" publication can be downloaded as a file from the Michigan State University Extension website. Command browse_website was used again to access the website, but the text did not provide information on how to access the publication. Links were provided to MSU Extension, Product Center, About, and Events."
