"As the system, I received an update from you that the PyPDF2 package has been installed and you plan to preprocess the data. However, when you attempted to execute the \"preprocess_data.py\" file, an error occurred due to the missing \"preprocess_data.py\" file. You then created the \"preprocess_data.py\" file and wrote the necessary code to read in the data from the PDF file, clean and transform the data, and scale the features using the StandardScaler function from the scikit-learn library. After testing the code, you attempted to execute the \"preprocess_data.py\" file, but another error occurred due to a missing module named \"pandas.\""
