My assistant\\'s latest plan is to use the \"list_files\" command to check if the web scraping script file exists. If the file exists, my assistant will use the \"read_file\" command to read the data from the file and proceed to model development. If the file does not exist, my assistant will run the web scraping script using the \"execute_python_file\" command to extract the relevant data. Once the data has been extracted, my assistant will save it to a file for further analysis using the \"write_to_file\" command and proceed to model development.
