        "text": "I plan to preprocess the data by cleaning, transforming, and scaling the features as necessary. Then, I will split the data into training and testing sets using the 'train_test_split' function from the scikit-learn library. I will then instantiate various machine learning models and train them on the training data, experimenting with different hyperparameters and feature engineering techniques. After that, I will evaluate the performance of the models on the testing data using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Finally, I will select the best-performing model(s) and use them to generate predictions on new or unseen data.",
        "reasoning": "This plan follows standard machine learning procedures, including preprocessing the data, splitting into training and testing sets, training and evaluating models, and selecting the best-performing model(s) for prediction.",
