Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\nThe OS you are running on is: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)\n\nGOALS:\n\n1. Data Collection: Gather historical data of meme coins, including price movements, trading volumes, market capitalization, and relevant indicators.\n2. Model Development: Train machine learning models using the collected data to predict potential meme coin growth. Experiment with various algorithms and feature engineering techniques.\n3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics and validation techniques. Select the model(s) that demonstrate the highest accuracy for identifying high-growth meme coins.\n4. Predictive Analysis: Use the selected model(s) to generate predictions on new or unseen data. Identify meme coins with a high probability of experiencing significant growth in the near future.\n5. Investment Strategy: Develop an investment strategy based on the model predictions. Consider risk tolerance, investment horizon, and diversification. Implement proper risk management techniques and portfolio allocation strategies.\n\nIt takes money to let you run.

If it does, we will read the data from the file using the 'read_file' command and proceed to model development. If the file does not exist, we will run the web scraping script using the 'execute_python_file' command to extract the relevant data. Once the data has been extracted, we will save it to a file for further analysis using the 'write_to_file' command and proceed to model development. It is important to ensure that the extracted data is accurate and relevant before proceeding with model development. I received a list of files from the 'list_files' command and plan to check if the extracted data file exists, read the data if it does, or run the web scraping script to extract the data if it doesn't. Once the data has been extracted, I will save it to a file for further analysis and model development. I will use the 'read_file' command to read the data from the file 'michigan_trees.txt'."
