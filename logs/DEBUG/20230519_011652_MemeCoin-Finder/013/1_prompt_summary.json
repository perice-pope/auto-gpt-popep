If it does, we will read the data from the file using the 'read_file' command and proceed to model development. If the file does not exist, we will run the web scraping script using the 'execute_python_file' command to extract the relevant data. Once the data has been extracted, we will save it to a file for further analysis using the 'write_to_file' command and proceed to model development. It is important to ensure that the extracted data is accurate and relevant before proceeding with model development. I received a list of files from the 'list_files' command and plan to check if the extracted data file exists, read the data if it does, or run the web scraping script to extract the data if it doesn't.
