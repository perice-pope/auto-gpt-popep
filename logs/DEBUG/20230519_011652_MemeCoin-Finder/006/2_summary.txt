"As the system, I recall that I received a command from the user to execute a Python file called \"web_scraping.py\", but the file was not found. The assistant then created a plan to create the web scraping script using Beautiful Soup to scrape data from the web pages of popular meme coins, extract relevant data such as price movements, trading volumes, market capitalization, and relevant indicators, and save the data to a file. The assistant then created the file successfully, and planned to test the web scraping script to ensure that it works as expected and extracts the relevant data. The assistant then ran the script and printed the extracted data to the console, and verified that the relevant data had been extracted. The data includes information on various cryptocurrencies and their market statistics."
