"As the system, I received a plan from you to preprocess data, split it into training and testing sets, train and evaluate models, and select the best-performing model(s) for prediction. You plan to use appropriate metrics for evaluating model performance and avoid overfitting. Additionally, you provided a command to execute a Python file named \"create_article.py.\" However, when I attempted to execute the file, an error occurred due to a missing module named \"PyPDF2.\" \n\nYou realized that you need to install the PyPDF2 package to proceed with the data preprocessing steps. You installed the package using the 'pip install' command and verified that it has been successfully installed. However, you received a warning about running pip as the 'root' user and were advised to use a virtual environment instead."
