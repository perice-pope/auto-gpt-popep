Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\nThe OS you are running on is: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)\n\nGOALS:\n\n1. Data Collection: Gather historical data of meme coins, including price movements, trading volumes, market capitalization, and relevant indicators.\n2. Model Development: Train machine learning models using the collected data to predict potential meme coin growth. Experiment with various algorithms and feature engineering techniques.\n3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics and validation techniques. Select the model(s) that demonstrate the highest accuracy for identifying high-growth meme coins.\n4. Predictive Analysis: Use the selected model(s) to generate predictions on new or unseen data. Identify meme coins with a high probability of experiencing significant growth in the near future.\n5. Investment Strategy: Develop an investment strategy based on the model predictions. Consider risk tolerance, investment horizon, and diversification. Implement proper risk management techniques and portfolio allocation strategies.\n\nIt takes money to let you run. Your API budget is $2.000\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4.

My assistant then created a plan to create the web scraping script using Beautiful Soup to scrape data from the web pages of popular meme coins, extract relevant data such as price movements, trading volumes, market capitalization, and relevant indicators, and save the data to a file. The assistant created the file successfully and tested the web scraping script to ensure that it works as expected and extracts the relevant data. The assistant then ran the script and printed the extracted data to the console, and verified that the relevant data had been extracted. The data includes information on various cryptocurrencies and their market statistics. No new developments have occurred since then."
