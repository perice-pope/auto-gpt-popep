Here are some of the most common types of trees found in Michigan:\n\n1. Eastern White Pine\n\nThe Eastern White Pine is a tall, straight tree that can grow up to 150 feet tall. It has a soft, light-colored wood that is often used for construction. The needles are long and slender, and the cones are large and cylindrical.\n\n2. Red Oak\n\nThe Red Oak is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 100 feet tall. It has a hard, strong wood that is often used for furniture. The leaves are lobed and have a deep green color in the summer, turning red in the fall.\n\n3. Sugar Maple\n\nThe Sugar Maple is a medium-sized deciduous tree that can grow up to 100 feet tall. It has a hard, dense wood that is often used for flooring and furniture. The leaves are large and have five lobes, turning a brilliant orange-red in the fall.\n\n4. American Beech\n\nThe American Beech is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 120 feet tall. It has a smooth gray bark and a hard, strong wood that is often used for furniture. The leaves are oval-shaped and have a dark green color in the summer, turning a light brown in the fall.\n\n5. Black Cherry\n\nThe Black Cherry is a medium-sized deciduous tree that can grow up to 80 feet tall. It has a reddish-brown bark and a hard, strong wood that is often used for furniture. The leaves are oval-shaped and have a dark green color in the summer, turning yellow and red in the fall.\n\nThese are just a few of the many types of trees found in Michigan. Each tree has its own unique characteristics and uses, making them an important part of the state's ecosystem and economy."
