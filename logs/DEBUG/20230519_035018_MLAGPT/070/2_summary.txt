"I attempted to execute the command \"sudo apt-get install file -y && file cryptocurrency_data_filtered.csv\" using the execute_shell command, but received an error message stating that the file was not found. My computer then sent a message that the command execute_shell returned an error stating \"sudo: not found\". However, I received a new message from my computer indicating that the command execute_shell was successful and installed the packages libmagic-mgc, libmagic1, and file. The installation process outputted \"cryptocurrency_data_filtered.csv: ASCII text\"."
