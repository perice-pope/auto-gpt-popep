"I used \"execute_python_file\" command to run \"analyze_data.py\" file, but it returned an error saying that \"sklearn\" module is not installed. In the past, I used \"execute_shell\" command to install necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn, which returned a message that the libraries were successfully installed. However, there was a warning message that running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behavior with the system package manager, and it is recommended to use a virtual environment instead."
