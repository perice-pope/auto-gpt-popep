"As a user, I received a task to browse a website to download \"cryptocurrency_data.csv\" from https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/data/. Command browse_website returned that the website does not provide a specific link to download the file, but historical data can be downloaded in a standardized CSV format for free without the need to register. I executed the command \"wget https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/cdd/Bitfinex_BTCUSD_d.csv -O cryptocurrency_data.csv\" to download the file. No new developments have occurred."
