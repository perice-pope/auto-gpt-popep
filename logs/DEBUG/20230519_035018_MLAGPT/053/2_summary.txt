"I attempted to read a file with the command 'read_file', but it returned too much output. I then used the command 'execute_shell' to create a filtered version of the file, which was successful. However, when I attempted to identify potential meme coins using the 'execute_python_file' command with the script 'identify_potential_meme_coins.py', it returned an error. The error was caused by a KeyError for the column 'Symbol'."
