"I previously encountered an error while attempting to execute the 'analyze_data.py' script due to the file 'cryptocurrency_data.csv' not being found. I used the 'list_files' command to investigate the directory and found that the file was missing. However, I have now successfully obtained the file by using the command \"execute_shell\" to download it from a website. The 'list_files' command returned a list of all the files in the directory."
