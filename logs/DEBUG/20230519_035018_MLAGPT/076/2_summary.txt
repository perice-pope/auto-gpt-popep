"I received a new development where I executed the shell command \"head -n 1 cryptocurrency_data_filtered.csv\" and received the output \"Date,Symbol,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume,BTC Volume\". I then executed the command \"write_to_file\" with the filename \"cryptocurrency_data_filtered.csv\" and text \"Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume,Market Cap\". The command was successful and the file was written to. Finally, I executed the command \"read_file\" with the filename \"cryptocurrency_data_filtered.csv\"."
