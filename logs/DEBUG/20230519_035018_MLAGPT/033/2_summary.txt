"I successfully used the 'write_to_file' command to create a Python script called 'coin_data_downloader.py', which downloads cryptocurrency data from a website, saves it to a CSV file, and prints a success message. The 'write_to_file' command returned a message stating that the file was written to successfully. I also used the 'execute_shell_popen' command to install the requests, pandas, and beautifulsoup4 packages using the command line \"pip install requests pandas beautifulsoup4\". The command successfully started a subprocess with PID:'260'. However, when I tried to execute the Python script with the 'execute_python_file' command, I received an error message stating that html5lib was not found, so I used the 'execute_shell_popen' command to install it."
