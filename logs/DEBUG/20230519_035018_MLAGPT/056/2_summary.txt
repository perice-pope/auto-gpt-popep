"I executed the command 'find / -name cryptocurrency_data_filtered.csv 2>/dev/null' and found the file in the directory '/app/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/'. I then executed the command 'file /app/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/cryptocurrency_data_filtered.csv' but received an error message of 'not found'. Despite this, I was able to successfully read the file using the command 'read_file' with the filename '/app/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/cryptocurrency_data_filtered.csv'."
