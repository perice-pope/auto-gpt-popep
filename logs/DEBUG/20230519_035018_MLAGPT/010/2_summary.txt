"I attempted to execute \"analyze_data.py\" but it returned an error. My assistant suggested creating a new Python file to analyze the data using libraries such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn. I executed \"write_to_file\" to create the file \"analyze_data.py\" with the necessary code. However, when I tried to execute \"analyze_data.py\" again, it still returned an error. My assistant suggested using pip to install necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn. We installed the libraries using \"execute_shell\" command."
