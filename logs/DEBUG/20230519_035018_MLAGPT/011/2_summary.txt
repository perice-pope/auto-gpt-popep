"I used the \"execute_shell\" command to install necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn. The command returned a message that the libraries were successfully installed. There was a warning message that running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behavior with the system package manager. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead."
