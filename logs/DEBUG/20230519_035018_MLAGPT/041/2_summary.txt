"I used the 'write_to_file' command to successfully create a script called 'coin_data_downloader.py'. The command returned 'File written to successfully.' I then executed the python file using the command '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_python_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"coin_data_downloader.py\"}}}'. The script imports libraries, retrieves cryptocurrency data using the CoinGecko API, and saves the data to a CSV file. The script also prints 'Data downloaded and saved successfully!' when completed."
