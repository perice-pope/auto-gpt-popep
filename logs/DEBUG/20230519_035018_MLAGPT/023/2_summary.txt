"As a user, I was tasked to browse a website to download \"cryptocurrency_data.csv\" and downloaded it using the command \"wget https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/cdd/Bitfinex_BTCUSD_d.csv -O cryptocurrency_data.csv\". I then tried to analyze the data using the command \"analyze_code\", which resulted in an error. I received suggestions from an agent to improve the 'analyze_data.py' script to accurately identify potential meme coins by expanding the data sources, analyzing social media sentiment, using machine learning algorithms, monitoring market capitalization, and analyzing community engagement. I messaged the agent an updated script, but it did not include any changes or improvements. The agent offered to provide specific lines of code to implement the suggestions."
