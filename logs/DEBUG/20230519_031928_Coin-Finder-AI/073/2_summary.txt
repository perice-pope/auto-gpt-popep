"As the system, I executed the read_file command which returned an HTML code containing a redirection link to a CSV file on coingecko.com. As me, I then executed the execute_shell command with an argument of \"curl -o meme_data.csv https://www.coingecko.com/price_charts/export/68078.csv\". My computer returned STDOUT and STDERR, with the former being empty and the latter containing a progress report of the download."
