"As a system, I received a command to analyze the code, but it returned an error stating that the model 'gpt-4' does not exist. I then used the 'list_agents' command to get a list of agents, and started a new agent named 'coin_finder' tasked with analyzing Python code to identify potential high-growth meme coins. The agent prompts the user to provide the Python code to be analyzed. Command start_agent returned: Agent coin_finder created with key 0. First response: I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your local files or code. Can you please provide the Python code for me to analyze? I messaged the agent with the user's provided code, which trains multiple models, evaluates their performance, selects the best performing model, and uses it to generate predictions on new or unseen data."
