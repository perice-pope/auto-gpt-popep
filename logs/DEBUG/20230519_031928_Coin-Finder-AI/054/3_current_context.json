Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\nThe OS you are running on is: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)\n\nGOALS:\n\n1. Data Collection: Gather historical data of meme coins, including price movements, trading volumes, and relevant indicators.\n2. Model Development: Train machine learning models using the collected data to predict potential high-growth meme coins. Experiment with different algorithms and feature engineering techniques.\n3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics. Select the model(s) that demonstrate the highest accuracy in identifying meme coins with significant growth potential.\n4. Predictive Analysis: Use the selected model(s) to generate predictions on new or unseen data. Identify meme coins with a high likelihood of experiencing significant growth in the near future.\n5. Write identified coins to .txt file\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4.
