The installation was successful and the `execute_python_file` command was executed again to analyze the performance of the three models and select the best performing model. Additionally, I received a command to execute the `analyze_models.py` file. However, the `execute_python_file` command returned an error stating that the file does not exist. As a result, the user wrote to the file using the `write_to_file` command with the filename `analyze_models.py`. The file was successfully written. The user then issued another `execute_python_file` command with the filename `analyze_models.py`.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\nNothing new happened.\n\"\"\"\n"
