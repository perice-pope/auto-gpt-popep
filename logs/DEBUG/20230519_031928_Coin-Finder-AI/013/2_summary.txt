"As a system, I recall that the user has written a Python script named \"model_training.py\" to train machine learning models. The script loads data from \"data.csv\" and splits it into training and testing sets. It then trains multiple models and evaluates their performance using appropriate metrics. The script selects the best performing model and uses it to generate predictions on new or unseen data."
