"As a system, I received a command to analyze the code, but it returned an error stating that the model 'gpt-4' does not exist. I then used the 'list_agents' command to get a list of agents, and started a new agent named 'coin_finder' tasked with analyzing Python code to identify potential high-growth meme coins. The agent prompts the user to provide the Python code to be analyzed. In the past, I trained multiple models, evaluated their performance, selected the best performing model, and used it to generate predictions on new or unseen data."
