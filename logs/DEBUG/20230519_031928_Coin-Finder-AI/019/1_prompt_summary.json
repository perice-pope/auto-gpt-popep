I then used the 'list_agents' command to get a list of agents, and started a new agent named 'coin_finder' tasked with analyzing Python code to identify potential high-growth meme coins. The agent prompts the user to provide the Python code to be analyzed. Command start_agent returned: Agent coin_finder created with key 0. First response: I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your local files or code. Can you please provide the Python code for me to analyze? I messaged the agent with the user's provided code, which trains multiple models, evaluates their performance, selects the best performing model, and uses it to generate predictions on new or unseen data.\"}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Command message_agent returned: This Python code loads data from a CSV file, splits it into training and testing sets, trains and evaluates multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest), selects the best performing model, and generates predictions on new or unseen data.\\n\\nThe data is loaded from a CSV file hosted on GitHub, using the pandas library. The data is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn library. The training set contains the 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'size_sqft', 'min_to_subway', 'floor', and 'building_age_yrs' features, while the target variable is the 'rent' column.\\n\\nThe code trains and evaluates three models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. For each model, the code fits the model to the training data, generates predictions on the testing data, calculates the mean squared error (MSE) between the predictions and the actual values, and stores the MSE in a dictionary called model_performance.\\n\\nThe code then selects the best performing model by finding the model with the lowest MSE and stores the name of the best model in the variable best_model.\\n\\nFinally, the code generates predictions on new or unseen data using the best performing model. The new data consists of three rows, each with six features.
