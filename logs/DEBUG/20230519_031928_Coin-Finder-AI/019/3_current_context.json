Data Collection: Gather historical data of meme coins, including price movements, trading volumes, and relevant indicators.\n2. Model Development: Train machine learning models using the collected data to predict potential high-growth meme coins. Experiment with different algorithms and feature engineering techniques.\n3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics. Select the model(s) that demonstrate the highest accuracy in identifying meme coins with significant growth potential.\n4. Predictive Analysis: Use the selected model(s) to generate predictions on new or unseen data. Identify meme coins with a high likelihood of experiencing significant growth in the near future.\n5. Write identified coins to .txt file\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2.

I messaged the agent with the user's provided code, which trains multiple models, evaluates their performance, selects the best performing model, and uses it to generate predictions on new or unseen data. The agent prompts the user to provide the Python code to be analyzed. Command message_agent returned the details of the Python code, including the libraries used, the data loaded from a CSV file hosted on GitHub, the splitting of the data into training and testing sets, the training and evaluation of three models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest), the selection of the best performing model, and the generation of predictions on new or unseen data. The user's provided code was executed, and the predictions generated by the best performing model were printed to the console."
