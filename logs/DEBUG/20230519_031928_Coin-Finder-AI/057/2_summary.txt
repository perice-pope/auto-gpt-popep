"As a system, I received a redirection message after issuing the execute_shell command to download the csv file using \"curl -o meme_data.csv https://www.coingecko.com/price_charts/export/68078.csv\". The command returned three times, each with a redirection message. As a result, I tried to read the file multiple times, but received redirection messages each time. The user then attempted to delete the file again, which was successful. Command delete_file returned: Error: File has already been deleted. I issued the execute_shell command to download the csv file again and received a redirection message three times. The command returned an empty STDOUT and had a non-empty STDERR.
