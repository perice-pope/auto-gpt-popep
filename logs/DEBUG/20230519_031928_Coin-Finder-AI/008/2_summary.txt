"As a system, I recall that the user executed a shell command to install beautifulsoup4 and requests packages, which were successful with no errors, but with a warning about running pip as root. The installed beautifulsoup4 version is 4.12.2 and requests version is 2.30.0. Additionally, the user executed two commands, one to execute a Python file named \"data_collection.py\" and another to search for popular cryptocurrency exchanges on Google. My computer returned a list of the top cryptocurrency exchanges ranked by volume, trust score, and other metrics. The list includes exchanges like Crypto.com, Binance, and Coinbase, among others. The number of cryptocurrency users globally stands at 673 million, and the expected compound annual growth rate is 14.40% by 2027, with a total sum of $64.87 billion. However, when the user tried to execute the Python file \"data_collection.py\", the computer returned an error stating that the file does not exist. The user then tried to create the file using the shell command \"nano data_collection.py\"."
