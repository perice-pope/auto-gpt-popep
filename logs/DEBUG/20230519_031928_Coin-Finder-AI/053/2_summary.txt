"As a system, I received a redirection message after a command to read the file. The user then successfully downloaded the csv file using the execute_shell command. A command to delete the file returned an error message stating the file had already been deleted. Most recently, the command to read_file returned another redirection message to the csv file. I then issued the execute_shell command again to download the csv file using \"curl -o meme_data.csv https://www.coingecko.com/price_charts/export/68078.csv\". The command returned three times, each with a redirection message."
