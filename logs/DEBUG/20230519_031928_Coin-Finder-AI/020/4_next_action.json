Once the module is installed, we can use the `execute_python_file` command to execute the Python code and analyze the performance of the three models. After selecting the best performing model, we can use the results to train and evaluate machine learning models using historical data of meme coins.",

We can then use the `execute_python_file` command to execute the Python code and analyze the performance of the three models. After selecting the best performing model, we can use the results to train and evaluate machine learning models using historical data of meme coins.",
