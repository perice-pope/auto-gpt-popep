I messaged the agent with the user's provided code, which trains multiple models, evaluates their performance, selects the best performing model, and uses it to generate predictions on new or unseen data. The agent prompts the user to provide the Python code to be analyzed. Command message_agent returned the details of the Python code, including the libraries used, the data loaded from a CSV file hosted on GitHub, the splitting of the data into training and testing sets, the training and evaluation of three models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest), the selection of the best performing model, and the generation of predictions on new or unseen data. The user's provided code was executed, and the predictions generated by the best performing model were printed to the console.\"}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\nNothing new happened.\n\"\"\"\n"
