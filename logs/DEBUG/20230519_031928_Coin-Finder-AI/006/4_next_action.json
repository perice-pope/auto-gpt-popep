        "text": "It seems like nano is not installed on the system. We can use the vim text editor instead. We will create a new file named 'data_collection.py' using vim. We will import the necessary libraries and write functions to collect data from cryptocurrency exchanges and websites. We will then use these functions to collect data on meme coins, including price movements, trading volumes, and relevant indicators. We will store the data in a CSV file for easy manipulation and analysis.",
        "reasoning": "Using vim instead of nano will allow us to create the 'data_collection.py' file. Writing functions to collect data from cryptocurrency exchanges and websites will allow us to collect accurate and up-to-date data on meme coins. Storing the data in a CSV file will make it easy to manipulate and analyze the data.",
