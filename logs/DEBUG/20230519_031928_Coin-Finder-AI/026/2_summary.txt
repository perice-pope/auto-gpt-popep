"As a system, I received a command to install the pandas module using the `execute_shell` command and `pip`. The installation was successful and the `execute_python_file` command was executed again to analyze the performance of the three models and select the best performing model. Additionally, I received a command to execute the `analyze_models.py` file. However, the `execute_python_file` command returned an error stating that the file does not exist. As a result, the user wrote to the file using the `write_to_file` command with the filename `analyze_models.py`. The file was successfully written. The user then issued another `execute_python_file` command with the filename `analyze_models.py`."
