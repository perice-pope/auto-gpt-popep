"As a system, I have not received any new commands or information. My assistant suggested using the `write_to_file` command to write the Python code to a file and the `execute_python_file` command to execute the Python code and analyze the performance of the three models. After selecting the best performing model, we can use the results to train and evaluate machine learning models using historical data of meme coins. However, the `execute_python_file` command returned an error indicating that the `pandas` module is not installed. My assistant suggested using the `execute_shell` command to install the `pandas` module using `pip`. We then executed the `execute_python_file` command again to analyze the performance of the three models and select the best performing model."
