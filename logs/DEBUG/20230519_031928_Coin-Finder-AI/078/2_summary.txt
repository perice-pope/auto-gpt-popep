"As me, I executed the execute_shell command with an argument of \"curl -o new_meme_data2.csv https://www.coingecko.com/price_charts/export/68078.csv\". My computer returned STDOUT and STDERR, with the latter containing a progress report of the download. The new CSV file is called new_meme_data2.csv. Later, I used the read_file command to read the contents of the new_meme_data2.csv file."
