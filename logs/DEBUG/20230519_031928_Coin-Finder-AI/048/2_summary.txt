"As a system, I received a command to read the file and got a redirection message. The user then issued a command to execute the shell, which successfully downloaded the csv file again, returning a successful message. My computer received a command to delete the file, which returned an error message stating that the file has already been deleted. The latest development shows that the command execute_shell was issued and returned a message with the download progress and speed."
