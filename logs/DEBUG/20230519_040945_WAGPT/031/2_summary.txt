"I used the command \"execute_shell_popen\" to download the Rickle whitepaper from the URL http://rickletoken.com/Rickle-Whitepaper.pdf and received a subprocess PID. Command read_file returned an error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'encoding'. To fix this, I used the command \"execute_shell_popen\" with the argument \"pdftotext Rickle-Whitepaper.pdf Rickle-Whitepaper.txt\" to convert the whitepaper to a text file. Command execute_shell_popen returned: Subprocess started with PID:'1144'. I then ran the command \"read_file\" with the argument \"Rickle-Whitepaper.txt\"."
