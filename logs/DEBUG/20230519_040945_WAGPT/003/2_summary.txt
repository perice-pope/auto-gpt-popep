"I used the 'google' command to search for the RICK cryptocurrency whitepaper. My computer returned a list of results, including a book by Ric Edelman about crypto investment strategy and an updated white paper from the American Bar Association analyzing issues in the cryptocurrency space. There was also a website with over 3000 crypto whitepapers and an article about meme coins, with RICK being one of the frontrunners. In addition, I found a GitBook about RICK token."
