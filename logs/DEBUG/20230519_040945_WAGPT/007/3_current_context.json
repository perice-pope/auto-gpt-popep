There were also results for a Rick token whitepaper, a website containing a database of cryptocurrency whitepapers, and the original Bitcoin whitepaper. Additionally, my computer returned search results for the Infinite Ricks (RICK) cryptocurrency, which is the first Multiverse cryptocurrency and is accepted in any universe. The results also showed a new TRC-20 token launched by Infinite Ricks. There were also links to websites like crypto.com, Coinbase, and BitDegree.org that provide information on the RICK coin price chart and the crypto market cap. Lastly, there was a link to a website called cryptoricks.com that offers facilitated access to a system growing larger and more accepted with every passing day."
