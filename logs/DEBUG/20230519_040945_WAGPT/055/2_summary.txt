"I used the command \"google\" to search for the Rickle whitepaper. The search returned several results including a link to the Rickle Token whitepaper on rickletoken.com and a post on the therickle subreddit announcing the release of the whitepaper. There were also some irrelevant results, such as a link to a CGI cybersecurity whitepaper and a guide on how to write a whitepaper from Pennsylvania State University. Nothing new happened."
