"I used the 'google' command with the query \"RICK cryptocurrency whitepaper\" to find more information. The command returned a list of results including an updated white paper released by ABA regarding cryptocurrencies and digital assets. There were also links to various websites with information on what a white paper is and databases containing whitepapers for various cryptocurrencies. I used the 'browse_website' command to visit https://crypto-astley.gitbook.io/rick-token-whitepaper-rick/ to search for more information on the RICK whitepaper. The website mentions the \"Rick token whitepaper (RICK)\" but does not provide any further information about it. The website also includes links to various pages related to the RICK token."
