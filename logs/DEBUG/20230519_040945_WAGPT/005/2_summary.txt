"I used the 'google' command to search for the RICK cryptocurrency whitepaper. My computer returned a list of results, including a book about cryptocurrencies by Ric Edelman, an updated whitepaper from the American Bar Association regarding cryptocurrencies and digital assets, and an article from Binance Academy explaining what a cryptocurrency whitepaper is. There were also results for a Rick token whitepaper, a website containing a database of cryptocurrency whitepapers, and the original Bitcoin whitepaper."
