"I used the 'browse_website' command to verify the RICK cryptocurrency website and found information about their services, block explorer, staking calculator, community, and upcoming events. However, the website did not provide information on where to download the whitepaper. When I used the 'google' command again to search for the whitepaper download, my computer returned various results including a website called Whitepaper.io and a page on the Binance Academy website explaining what a cryptocurrency whitepaper is. I also used the 'browse_website' command again to find out if the cryptoricks.com website was a reputable source for the RICK whitepaper, but the website did not provide any information on this."
