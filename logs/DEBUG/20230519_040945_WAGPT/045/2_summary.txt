"I executed the shell command \"execute_shell_popen\" and started a subprocess with PID 1298. I attempted to read the file \"/app/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/Rickle-Whitepaper.txt\" but received an error that the file does not exist. Instead, I used the command \"google\" to search for the Rickle whitepaper in PDF format."
