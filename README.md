# AutoGPT Shell

This repository contains a shell for running the AutoGPT program using Docker. It provides a convenient way to pull the Docker image and run the AutoGPT container for specific purposes. Additionally, the repository includes the 'logs' and 'data' directories which store the logs and generated data by the AutoGPT program.

## Prerequisites
- Docker: Install Docker on your system before using this shell.

## Usage
Follow the steps below to use the AutoGPT shell:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/perice-pope/auto-gpt-popep.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd auto-gpt-popep
   ```

3. Customize Environment Variables:
   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the variables as per your requirements.
   - The `MEMORY_BACKEND` variable defines the memory backend for AutoGPT (default: `redis`).
   - The `REDIS_HOST` variable specifies the Redis host (default: `redis`).

4. Run the AutoGPT Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will pull the Docker image and start the AutoGPT container.

5. Accessing the AutoGPT Workspace:
   - The AutoGPT workspace is located in the `auto_gpt_workspace` directory.
   - You can place your data files inside the `data` directory.
   - The generated logs can be found in the `logs` directory.

6. Customization (Optional):
   - If you have additional files like `azure.yaml` or `ai_settings.yaml` that need to be used by the AutoGPT program, uncomment the corresponding lines in the `docker-compose.yml` file and place the files in the respective directories.

## Moving Logs and Data to the Cloud
To inspect and gain insights from the logs and data generated by the AutoGPT program, you can move them to the cloud. Consider using cloud storage services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage to store and analyze the logs and data files.
